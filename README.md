Yes, you are already late in registering for Technical Matric N3 or two languages but we still want to assist you.... 

But why are we still reaching out to you? 


Because this is the last year in 2020 Technical Matric will be offered

Registrations for Technical Matric N3 are long way closed in March 2020, but we have a window of opportunity to try register you and ensure you write in November exams. Unfortunately the time given is pretty short as I mentioned the official closing date long passed. 

You have up until tomorrow to register!


We have up until tomorrow to register you for Technical Matric or the two languages after which we might not get another chance. The Department of Higher Education is phasing out Technical Matric N3 or rather the two languages that are compulsory in Technical Matric which are Business English and Sake Afrikaans.


There are many advantages of doing Technical Matric N3 beside from being easier and best suited for out of school people or adults already working and it is our wish that as many students as possible register and get their matric certificate.

To get more information on Technical Matric N3 visit our website: Click Here

Do not be left out, register today!

There are a few conditions involved and please inquire before making any payment. 

Closing date is end of business day tomorrow (Friday 25th)

Record sheet 


Certainly! Here's how the intake form structure could be improved for clarity, efficiency, and comprehensiveness:
10.Suggestions for Improvement
1.	Header Section:
o	Include a form title such as "Client Intake Form – Sci-Bono Walk-In Center."
o	Add fields for the date of intake and intake session ID/reference number for record-keeping.
2.	Facilitator Information:
o	Section title: "Facilitator Details."
o	Include fields for full name, contact details, and position/title.
o	Consider adding a checkbox for identifying if this is an initial intake or a follow-up session.
3.	Client Information:
o	Section title: "Client Details."
o	Organize fields for basic demographics (e.g., Full Name, ID Number, Age, Gender, Race, Contact Information).
o	Include fields for the client’s current education level, employment status, and SAQA assessment status for better profiling.
4.	Purpose of Visit:
o	Ask clear, structured questions like:
	"What are you seeking guidance for today?" (e.g., Career Planning, Study Skills, Job Search, Learnerships, etc.).
	Include a dropdown or multiple-choice options to streamline responses.
5.	Career Guidance Information:
o	Reorganize into subcategories:
	Career Choice Guidance: Interests, strengths, and values.
	Study Skills Support: Current challenges, specific study techniques.
	Time Management Skills: Examples of issues they face, tools they already use.
	Job Search Skills: CV writing, interview techniques, etc.
6.	Work Readiness and Employment:
o	Reframe to focus on self-assessment of work readiness and skills enhancement.
o	Add fields for work history and relevant skills/training programs attended.
7.	Feedback and Service Improvements:
o	Add a well-defined section titled "Feedback."
o	Reframe vague questions like "How can we improve our services?" into targeted feedback prompts, e.g.,
	"What information or resources did you find most helpful today?"
	"What additional support would you like us to provide?"
8.	Facilitator Notes Section:
o	Structured prompts for facilitators to document key issues, action steps, and recommendations.
o	Add a checkbox for follow-ups and a space to record next steps or referrals made.
9.	General Layout Improvements:
o	Consistent formatting: Use bold section headers and concise instructions for better readability.
o	Avoid overlapping or vague questions (e.g., 1.16-1.20 appear unclear). Reframe or consolidate to avoid redundancy.
10.	Digital Option:
•	Consider a digital version with dropdown menus, radio buttons, and auto-fill options to speed up data entry. This could integrate with a CRM system for tracking client progress.
Here’s an example reorganization:
Header Section:
•	Date: ______
•	Session ID: ______
Facilitator Details:
•	Name: ______
•	Position: ______
•	Contact: ______
Client Details:
•	Name: ______
•	SAQA Status: ______
•	Field of Study: ______
•	Contact Information: ______
Purpose of Visit (Choose One):
•	Career Guidance
•	Study Skills Support
•	Job Search
...and so forth.
Designing effective intake forms requires balancing clarity, comprehensiveness, and user-friendliness. Here are some best practices to consider:
1. Clarity and Simplicity
•	Use clear and concise language; avoid jargon or overly technical terms.
•	Include short instructions where necessary to guide users on how to fill out the form.
•	Ensure the layout is logical, grouping related fields together in distinct sections.
2. Relevance
•	Only include fields that are directly relevant to the purpose of the intake form to avoid overwhelming users.
•	Use dropdown menus, checkboxes, or radio buttons for common answers to make it quicker to complete.
3. Organization
•	Structure the form into sections with headings (e.g., "Personal Information," "Reason for Visit," "Feedback").
•	Place essential information (e.g., name, contact details) at the start for easy identification.

System Design and Logical Programming
1. Input-Output Evaluation Steps
1.	Input Variables:
o	Collect data from electrical components:
	Resistors: Capture resistance (RR) and current flow.
	Capacitors: Measure capacitance (CC) and stored energy.
	Diodes: Analyze voltage drops and current flow directions.
o	Design modular systems where these components interact dynamically.
2.	Processing Logic:
o	Binary algorithms can evaluate system behavior:
	Assign binary states to each variable (e.g., 1 for "ON", 0 for "OFF").
	Calculate interactions using conditional statements.
2. Key Applications of Mathematical Operations
Integral Applications:
•	Energy Calculation:
o	For capacitors and power systems, compute cumulative energy stored or delivered: $$ E = \int P(t) \, dt $$
	P(t)P(t): Power as a function of time.
	Application: Analyze total energy consumption or storage over time.
Derivations:
•	Rate of Change in Phase Systems:
o	Derive current or voltage changes in real-time systems: $$ \frac{dI}{dt} \, \text{or} \, \frac{dV}{dt} $$
	II: Current.
	VV: Voltage.
	Application: Dynamic analysis in feedback systems to stabilize outputs.
3. Size Configuration in Electrical Systems
1.	Wire Sizing:
o	Optimize wire dimensions to minimize energy loss: $$ R = \rho \frac{l}{A} $$
	RR: Resistance.
	ρ\rho: Resistivity of the material.
	ll: Length of the wire.
	AA: Cross-sectional area.
	Use for selecting efficient conductor materials and minimizing power loss.
2.	Component Size Weighting:
o	Assign weighting factors to prioritize component efficiency:
	E.g., Capacitor size impact on system response vs. circuit stability.
	Balance performance with cost and material availability.
4. Phase Systems and Modular Analysis

Other Workplace Hazards and Precautionary Steps
Working with LaddersLadders and scaffolds account for about half of the injuries for electricians in the workplace. The involuntary recoil that can occur when a person is shocked can cause the person to be thrown from a ladder or high place. 
Many job site accidents involve the misuse of ladders. Make sure to follow the general rules every time you use any ladder. 
 
Following these rules can prevent serious injuries or even death:
Before using a ladder: inspect it. Look for loose or missing rungs, cleats, bolts, or screws. Also check for cracked, bent, broken, or badly worn rungs, cleats, or side rails. 
Before climbing a ladder: make sure you clear any debris from the base of the ladder so you do not trip over it when you descend.
Overview of Course Modules

o	Covers the basics of triangles, their properties, and foundational concepts.
2.	Triangle Theorems and Trig Functions:
o	Explores key theorems (like Pythagoras) and introduces trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent.
3.	The Unit Circle and Unique Triangles:
o	Focuses on understanding the unit circle, a critical tool for solving trigonometric problems.
4.	Trig Identities (Part 1 and 2):
o	Delves into essential identities like the Pythagorean and reciprocal identities, and how to use them in problem-solving.
5.	Lesson Summary:
o	A wrap-up of the concepts covered in the module to reinforce learning.
6.	Course Assessment:
o	Evaluates your grasp of the topics with problem-solving questions.
Tips for Success
•	Focus on Basics: Ensure a solid understanding of triangle properties and the unit circle before moving on to trigonometric identities.
•	Practice Regularly: Trigonometry requires consistent problem-solving to master. Work on example problems provided in the course.
•	Use Visual Aids: Diagrams and graphs can be incredibly helpful when learning trigonometric functions and theorems.
•	Prepare for the Assessment: Revisit each module and practice key concepts to aim for a high score.
•	Trigonometry is a very important tool for engineers and not just a subject to be studied in a classroom with no real-world practical applications. Trigonometry is the study of triangles and the principles are fundamental in electrical engineering because it is used to create circuits and describe the sinusoidal movement and characteristics of current and voltages in circuits. This electrical engineering course begins by introducing you to triangles and their theorems. You will learn about different types of triangles, intersecting lines and parallel lines. Thereafter, you will discover how to differentiate between congruent and similar triangles as well as supplementary and complementary angles. Moving on from there, you will be taught how to prove the Pythagorean theorem and how to use it to find the missing sides of a triangle. This online electrical course explores the unique angles and their expression as both a function and simple ratios as well as trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent.
•	Electrical parameters and values are better understood using the concept of the unit circle, angles, sine, cosine and tangent values and you will be taught how to express the sine, cosine and tangents of special angles in simple ratios. Through the concept of the unit circle, you will then gain an understanding of why the trigonometric functions have a negative sign for some angles. Since there are many special angles, remembering them can be a great challenge. Have you ever wondered if there is a simple way to easily remember the values of these special angles?

 ID NUMBER:         
ID   DIPLOMAT NUMBER:
  A National Accredited Technical Education Diploma (NATED) is basically an undergraduate qualification delivered under the auspices of the Quality Council for Trades and Occupations and the Department of Higher Education and Training. These certifications combine theory and practical work, and are registered on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF).”
Learners can embark on engineering studies ranging from N1 to N6 and on humanities courses from N4 to N6. The ultimate goal of the engineering NATED course is to study for an N6 Engineering Diploma, which takes approximately three years to complete, encompassing 18 months of theory and 18 months of practical experience. 
“A National Diploma is completely different from a degree,” explains Ayobolu, “in that the National Diploma is divided into three levels, which are N4, N5 and N6. On completion of each level, learners are issued with a National Certificate.”
This type of qualification is aimed primarily at giving the learner the technical, theoretical, practical and workplace knowledge and skills required in their chosen occupational or vocational area. The courses are designed to enable learners to progressively obtain a qualification by completing the related N4, N5 and N6 courses in a particular vocational or occupational area, either piecemeal with breaks between the courses, or in one extended study period of a year or 18 months. The knowledge and skills learned are then applied in the workplace for an extended period before certification is awarded.
Ayobolu explains how NATED qualifications fit into the academic structure. “According to the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) NQF Act 67 of 2008, the framework consists of 10 levels that are divided into three bands. Levels 1 to 4 are the equivalent of Grades 9 to 12, as well as occupational certificates. Levels 5 to 8 equal higher certificates and diplomas; advanced certificates, degrees and advanced diplomas; honours degrees; postgraduate diplomas and occupational certificates. Levels 9 and 10 are master’s and doctorates, respectively.”
A NATED diploma – on NQF 6 – is one level below a bachelor’s degree. Bachelor’s degrees are NQF level 7 qualifications. It is, however, possible to get your degree, if you meet the applicable requirements, once you have a National Diploma. Once a learner has received their NATED diploma, they can apply to study a B-Tech degree, with the provisos that it has to be in a related field and all admission requirements are met.
There are several advantages to choosing to study towards a NATED diploma. Ayobolu explains: “A NATED diploma allows the learner to develop practical skills founded on the latest theory and principles, combined with an extended period of between 18 and 24 months of on-the-job experience. 
“In addition, the N4, N5 and N6 modules can be completed as individual units of learning that develop specific knowledge and skills. While they form part of the complete qualification, they also equip the learners to be productively employed as second-level technicians.”
The top six advantages of completing a NATED qualification are: 
	At each level a significant volume of learning outcomes will be achieved. This prepares learners for employment, participation in society and community, and access to higher levels of education and training. Further education can lead to higher education studies.
	A certificate is awarded to all learners who successfully complete the requirements at Levels 1 to 5, and an advanced certificate is awarded at Level 6.
	This qualification offers both theoretical and practical learning with a strong workplace learning component.
	The qualification has been compared with qualifications and training offered in countries that have a strong vocational educational and training system designed for young adults, for those who enjoy upskilling themselves on an ongoing basis and for the updating of existing employees’ skills levels.
	Colleges could be more affordable than higher education institutions. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are willing to learn could receive financial aid from colleges. The colleges also have a variety of programmes and services, including student support centres.
	Learners are able to study a diploma part time, especially at private institutions and technical colleges. This means that while doing a diploma, the learner can get a part-time job to help pay for tuition fees.
Learners who have completed a NATED diploma will be able to work in a number of specialised positions within their chosen field. They should be aware, however, that certain higher-level positions typically require a degree. The advantage of having a NATED diploma is that the learner will already have a lot of practical experience that they can apply in the workplace. For example, an engineering NATED diploma will allow the learner to perform a wide variety of jobs, such as electrical work or working as a diesel mechanic.
Ayobolu  says: “Whether it’s a learner wanting to follow a more technical career path or an employee wanting to update their skills and earn a formal qualification, the way that NATED courses are structured means that they’re accessible to everyone. They’re also an option for those who simply can’t afford a university degree. With unemployment at an all-time high, as well as huge demand for technical skills, these types of qualifications also empower people to eventually start their own small business.”

Sequence of delivery 
The sequence of delivery of the Units within the National 4 Engineering Science Course is at the discretion of the centre, and the models suggested below simply exemplify possible approaches which may be developed to suit individual circumstances and resources. 
The example structures outlined below are similar to those shown in the National 5 Course Support Notes so that centres may plan, where applicable, for delivery to mixed level groups. (Further suggestions and specific advice can be found in the Unit Support Notes.) 
Fitting the Added Value Unit into a Course plan 
Note that the delivery of the Added Value Unit (Engineering Science Assignment) has been omitted from the diagrams and examples which follow. As the Added Value Unit is intended to build on knowledge, understanding and skills developed through the other Units, it will normally be delivered at the end of the Course. However, it may be possible to begin work on the Added Value Unit at an earlier stage, but only where it is clear that learners have already gained the required skills and knowledge. 
Example 1a: Sequential delivery of the Units, beginning with Engineering Contexts and Challenges 
In this example, the three Units are delivered sequentially, beginning with Engineering Contexts and Challenges, which provides an introduction to some important concepts which underpin the whole Course, including the systems approach and energy. 
The other two Units — Electronics and Control, and Mechanisms and Structures — may then follow, deepening the learners’ experience in these more focused areas. These two Units may




In this approach, the induction phase introduces the learner to the systems approach. This might involve the analysis of simple products and engineered systems. Typically this stage will only require a short time, but the systems approach will permeate the Course and so the learner’s knowledge and ability to analyse the engineered world will develop throughout the whole Course. 
The second phase, occupying most of the Course time, is where the majority of the engineering knowledge and skills are introduced and then developed. The modules may be taught in any order and covered in a linear or concurrent manner. 
In the final phase, the more demanding engineering concepts are

PRE-ASSESSMENT MODERATION PROCESS 
NB: The term “examiner “refers to the lecturer who is responsible for setting a test/assessment task. 
PRE-ASSESSEMENT MODERATION PROCESS AND TIMELINES
PROCESS	RESPONSIBILITY	TIMELINE	
Allocate specific examiners and moderators names, per 
subject per level, to each assessment on the Assessment 
plans. The examiner and moderator must be two different 
persons. 
(Note: Examiners and moderators must be subject experts. 
The allocated examiners and moderators must be teaching the 
subject and level. Empower all staff to develop and moderate) 
assessments)

Throughout the 
academic period 
Moderation of assessments tasks and tools 
(Pre-moderation of tests, assignments, pre-exam tests, etc.): 
• Check that the examiner completed the ‘Examiner’s and 
Moderator’s checklist’: 
- Technical criteria 
- Content coverage 
- Cognitive skills 
- Types of questions 
- Language and bias 
- Overall impression 
- Assessment tool 
• Start by going through the entire assessment task and tool 
• Determine whether the students will be able to complete 
the assessment within the given time 
• Moderator must also complete the moderator’s section on 
the ‘Examiner’s and moderator’s checklist’ 
• Moderator must give feedback regarding changes needed 
and make recommendations on checklist 
• Keep all evidence of the moderation process	HOD SEIGNOR LECTURE

Final approval of the assessment instrument for printing: 
• Print final approved assessment task and tool 
(Note: Check layout, fonts and alignment before 
submitting for printing			
oderate 10% or a minimum of 5 written assessments 
• Moderators should familiarise themselves with the assessment 
• The marked scripts selected for moderation should reflect best, 
medium and poor performance. 
• Moderators should use a green pen only. 
• Moderators should re-mark the entire script and also 
show all √ as indicated on the assessment tool. 
Subject Moderator 
(Subject expert: 
empower all staff ! 
peer moderation) 
Within 2 days after the 
marked assessments 
were handed to the 
moderator 
Feedback to marker: 
• Keep all evidence of the moderation process (E.g. 55 % / 66 %) 
Subject Moderator Within 2 days after the 
marked assessments 
were handed to the 
moderator 
Re-marking is strongly advised in the following instances: 
• If the variance between the marker’s and moderator’s marks is greater 
than 5% for more than half of the moderated scripts. 
(Note: A remark of the entire batch is advised if the variance is 
applicable to more than half of the sample moderated) 
• If the variance between the marker’s and moderator’s marks is the 
result of incorrect marking. 
(Note: Sections/specific question/s indicated by the moderator of 
the entire batch must be remarked.) 
Examples of incorrect marking: 
Awarding marks for incorrect answers 
Not awarding marks for correct answers 
Not marking alternative correct answers 
Incorrect allocation of marks 
• 

• o Inconsistent mark allocation for similar answers 
Marker Within 2 days after 
feedback was received 
from the moderator 
If re-marking was advised, 10 % of the entire batch should be moderated 
again on completion of re-marking. 
Subject Moderator Within 2 days after re-
marking 
Errors in the adding of marks made by the marker: 
• Add and check totals of all scripts again 
(Note: If for example, an adding error was made by the 
marker, the student must be given the correct (moderated) mark. 
The moderator should determine whether the error was restricted to 
the one script only. The moderator should moderate one or two 
additional scripts) 

Marker 
Hand assessments back to students 
• The converted mark must be indicated on the marked task, e.g. 
60/100 = 60% = 45/75. 
Lecturer First contact session 
with students 
Capturing of marks on IT system: 
After the moderation is completed the lecturer’s (red 
pen) marks must be captured on the IT system. 
(Note: All students must benefit from the moderation and not only the 
sample of scripts moderated. The aim of moderation is to ensure 
consistency in the marking process) 
Corrections should be done (Note: As part of remedial work the lecturer 
should go through the task with the students)

Integration 
To adopt a unified approach to education and training that will strengthen the human resources development 
capacity of the nation. 
• Relevance 
To be dynamic and responsive to national development needs. 
• Credibility 
To demonstrate national and international value and recognition of qualification and acquired competencies 
and skills. 
• Coherence 
To work within a consistent framework of principles and certification. 
• Flexibility 
To allow for creativity and resourcefulness when achieving Learning Outcomes, to cater for different learning 
styles and use a range of assessment methods, instruments and techniques. 
• Participation 
To enable stakeholders to participate in setting standards and co-ordinating the achievement of the 
qualification. 
• Access 
To address barriers to learning at each level to facilitate students’ progress. 
Applied Policing 
National Certificates (Vocational) Department of Education 3 
• Progression 
To ensure that the qualification framework permits individuals to move through the levels of the national 
qualification via different, appropriate combinations of the components of the delivery system. 
• Portability 
To enable students to transfer credits of qualifications from one learning institution and/or employer to 
another institution or employer. 
• Articulation 
To allow for vertical and horizontal mobility in the education system when accredited pre-requisites have 
been successfully completed. 
• Recognition of Prior Learning 
To grant credits for a unit of learning following an assessment or if a student possesses the capabilities 
specified in the outcomes statement. 
• Validity of assessments 
To ensure assessment covers a broad range of knowledge, skills, values and attitudes (SKVAs) needed to 
demonstrate applied competency. This is achieved through: 
 clearly stating the outcome to be assessed; 
 selecting the appropriate or suitable evidence; 
 matching the evidence with a compatible or appropriate method of assessment; and 
 selecting and constructing an instrument(s) of assessment. 
• Reliability 
To assure assessment practices are consistent so that the same result or judgment is arrived at if the 
assessment is replicated in the same context. This demands consistency in the interpretation of evidence; 
therefore, careful monitoring of assessment is vital. 
• Fairness and transparency 
To verify that no assessment process or method(s) hinders or unfairly advantages any student. The following 
could constitute unfairness in assessment: 
 Inequality of opportunities, resources or teaching and learning approaches 
 Bias based on ethnicity, race, gender, age, disability or social class 
 Lack of clarity regarding Learning Outcome being assessed 
 Comparison of students’ work with other students, based on learning styles and language 
• Practicability and cost-effectiveness 
To integrate assessment practices within an outcomes-based education and training system and strive for 
cost and time-effective assessment. 
2 ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR VOCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS 
The assessment structure for the National Certificates (Vocational) qualification is as follows: 
2.1 Internal continuous assessment (ICASS) 
Knowledge, skills values, and attitudes (SKVAs) are assessed throughout the year using assessment 
instruments such as projects, tests, assignments, investigations, role-play and case studies. The internal 
continuous assessment (ICASS) practical component is undertaken in a real workplace, a workshop or a 
“Structured Environment”. This component is moderated internally and externally quality assured by Umalusi. 
All internal continuous assessment (ICASS) evidence is kept in a Portfolio of Evidence (PoE) and must be 
readily available for monitoring, moderation and verification purposes. 
2.2 External summative assessment (ESASS) 
The external summative assessment is either a single or a set of written papers set to the requirements of 
the Subject Learning Outcomes. The Department of Education administers the theoretical component 
according to relevant assessment policies. 
Applied Policing Level 4 (January 2020) 
National Certificates (Vocational) Department of Education 4 
A compulsory component of external summative assessment (ESASS) is the integrated summative 
assessment task (ISAT). This assessment task draws on the students’ cumulative learning throughout the 
year. The task requires integrated application of competence and is executed under strict assessment 
conditions. The task should take place in a simulated or “Structured Environment”. The integrated summative 
assessment task (ISAT) is the most significant test of students’ ability to apply acquired knowledge. The integrated assessment approach allows students to be assessed in more than one subject with the 
same integrated summative assessment task (ISAT). External summative assessments will be conducted annually between October and December, with 
provision made for supplementary sittings. 
3 MODERATION OF ASSESSMENT 3.1 Internal moderation 
Assessment must be moderated according to the internal moderation policy of the Further Education and 
Training (FET) college. Internal college moderation is a continuous process. The moderator’s involvement 
starts with the planning of assessment methods and instruments and follows with continuous collaboration 
with and support to the assessors. Internal moderation creates common understanding of Assessment 
Standards and maintains these across vocational programmes. 
3.2 External moderation 
External moderation is conducted by the Department of Education, Umalusi and, where relevant, an 
Education and Training Quality Assurance (ETQA) body according to South African Qualifications Authority 
(SAQA) and Umalusi standards and requirements. The external moderator: 
• monitors and evaluates the standard of all summative assessments; 
• maintains standards by exercising appropriate influence and control over assessors; 
• ensures proper procedures are followed; 
• ensures summative integrated assessments are correctly administered; 
• observes a minimum sample of ten (10) to twenty-five (25) percent of summative assessments; 
• gives written feedback to the relevant quality assuror; and 
• moderates in case of a dispute between an assessor and a student. Policy on inclusive education requires that assessment procedures be customised for students who 
experience barriers to learning, and supported to enable these students to achieve their maximum potential. 
4 PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF INTERNAL CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT (ICASS) 
The period of validity of the internal continuous assessment mark is determined by the National Policy on the 
Conduct, Administration and Management of the Assessment of the National Certificates (Vocational). The internal continuous assessment (ICASS) must be re-submitted with each examination enrolment for 
which it constitutes a component. 
5 ASSESSOR REQUIREMENTS 
Assessors must be subject specialists and should ideally be declared competent against the standards set 
by the ETDP SETA. If the lecturer conducting the assessments has not been declared a competent 
assessor, an assessor who has been declared competent may be appointed to oversee the assessment 
process to ensure the quality and integrity of assessments. 
6 TYPES OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment benefits the student and the lecturer. It informs students about their progress and helps 
lecturers make informed decisions at different stages of the learning process. Depending on the intended 
purpose, different types of assessment can be used. 
Applied Policing 
National Certificates (Vocational) Department of Education 5 
6.1 Baseline assessment 
At the beginning of a level or learning experience, baseline assessment establishes the knowledge, skills, 
values and attitudes (SKVAs) that students bring to the classroom. This knowledge assists lecturers to plan 
learning programmes and learning activities. 
6.2 Diagnostic assessment 
This assessment diagnoses the nature and causes of learning barriers experienced by specific students. It is 
followed by guidance, appropriate support and intervention strategies. This type of assessment is useful to 
make referrals for students requiring specialist help. 
6.3 Formative assessment 
This assessment monitors and supports teaching and learning. It determines student strengths and 
weaknesses and provides feedback on progress. It determines if a student is ready for summative 
assessment. 
6.4 Summative assessment 
This type of assessment gives an overall picture of student progress at a given time. It determines whether 
the student is sufficiently competent to progress to the next level. 
7 PLANNING ASSESSMENT 
An assessment plan should cover three main processes: 
7.1 Collecting evidence 
The assessment plan indicates which Subject Outcomes and Assessment Standards will be assessed, what 
assessment method or activity will be used and when this assessment will be conducted. 
7.2 Recording 
Recording refers to the assessment instruments or tools with which the assessment will be captured or 
recorded. Therefore, appropriate assessment instruments must be developed or adapted. 
7.3 Reporting 
All the evidence is put together in a report to deliver a decision for the subject. 
8 METHODS OF ASSESSMENT 
Methods of assessment refer to who carries out the assessment and includes lecturer assessment, self-
assessment, peer assessment and group assessment	YES NOT

ASSESSMENT IN APPLIED POLICING 
1 SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENT 
At NQF levels 2, 3 and 4, lecturers will conduct assessments as well as develop a schedule of formal 
assessments that will be undertaken in the year. All three levels also have an external examination that 
accounts for 50 percent of the total mark. The marks allocated to assessment tasks completed during the 
year, kept or recorded in a PoE account for the other 50 percent. The PoE and the external assessment include practical and written components. The practical assessment 
in Applied Policing (Level 4) must, where necessary, be subjected to external moderation by Umlauts or an 
appropriate Education and Training Quality Assurance (ETQA) body, appointed by the Umlauts Council in 
terms of Section 28(2) of the General and Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Act, 2001 (Act 
No. 58 of 2001).

In information theory, the Shannon–Hartley theorem tells the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communications channel of a specified bandwidth in the presence of noise. It is an application of the noisy-channel coding theorem to the archetypal case of a continuous-time analog communications channel subject to Gaussian noise. The theorem establishes Shannon's channel capacity for such a communication link, a bound on the maximum amount of error-free information per time unit that can be transmitted with a specified bandwidth in the presence of the noise interference, assuming that the signal power is bounded, and that the Gaussian noise process is characterized by a known power or power spectral density. The law is named after Claude Shannon and Ralph Hartley.

	5.2 Power-limited case
amples	
	At a SNR of 0 dB (Signal power = Noise power) the Capacity in bits/s is equal to the bandwidth in hertz.
	If the SNR is 20 dB, and the bandwidth available is 4 kHz, which is appropriate for telephone communications, then C = 4000 log2(1 + 100) = 4000 log2 (101) = 26.63 kbit/s. Note that the value of S/N = 100 is equivalent to the SNR of 20 dB.
	If the requirement is to transmit at 50 kbit/s, and a bandwidth of 10 kHz is used, then the minimum S/N required is given by 50000 = 10000 log2(1+S/N) so C/B = 5 then S/N = 25 − 1 = 31, corresponding to an SNR of 14.91 dB (10 x log10(31)).
	What is the channel capacity for a signal having a 1 MHz bandwidth, received with a SNR of −30 dB ? That means a signal deeply buried in noise. −30 dB means a S/N = 10−3. It leads to a maximal rate of information of 106 log2 (1 + 10−3) = 1443 bit/s. These values are typical of the received ranging signals of the GPS, where the navigation message is sent at 50 bit/s (below the channel capacity for the given S/N), and whose bandwidth is spread to around 1 MHz by a pseudo-noise multiplication before transmission.
	As stated above, channel capacity is proportional to the bandwidth of the channel and to the logarithm of SNR. This means channel capacity can be increased linearly either by increasing the channel's bandwidth given a fixed SNR requirement or, with fixed bandwidth, by using higher-order modulations that need a very high SNR to operate. As the modulation rate increases, the spectral efficiency improves, but at the cost of the SNR requirement. Thus, there is an exponential rise in the SNR requirement if one adopts a 16QAM or 64QAM (see: Quadrature amplitude modulation); however, the spectral efficiency improves.
